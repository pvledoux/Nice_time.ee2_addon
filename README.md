#Pvl Nice_time v.0.2

This plugin converts a date to relative time.
It will output **'now'** if the date given is less then 5 seconds ago, **'xx unit ago'** will be output for longer intervals (where unit will be seconds, minutes, hours, days or weeks). If the date is greater than 4 weeks, it will return the full date formatted with the parameter _format_.

##Syntax

    {exp:nice_time date="{entry_date}" format="%d-%m-%Y %H:%i"}
    {exp:nice_time date="2012-09-{segment_3}" format="%D, %M %j, %Y" relative="no"}
    {exp:nice_time date="+3 days" format="<strong>%l</strong> %m/%d/%Y" relative="no"}

It will output these kinds of results:

    now
    30 seconds ago
    5 minutes ago
    2 days ago
    3 weeks ago
    30 seconds from now
    5 minutes from now
    2 days from now
    3 weeks from now
    11-12-2012 11:24
    Monday, September 6, 2012

depending on the interval.

##Parameter

<table>
<tr>
	<td><b>date</b></td>
	<td>is required. Can be a string date or a unix timestamp.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><b>format</b></td>
	<td>optional. See http://expressionengine.com/user_guide/templates/date_variable_formatting.html (default: %d-%m-%Y %H:%i)</td>

<tr>

##Future improvements

* Add parameters for the delay between the 'now', the 'xx unit ago' ouput and the normal date output
* Allow the use of tag pairs or single tag (to ease translation)
* Add parameter to set on which time the plugin must based the ouput (GMT, server time, etc)

Any improvement or remarks are welcome.
